          My Role: UX/UI Designer (from user research to final UI design)
          <br>Timeline: May 2018 - July 2018 (2 months in total)
          <br>FitJet is a responsive web application which helps users find suitable exercises and stay fit. This is a project which was conducted as a part of UI for UX Designers course at CareerFoundry. Herein, I covered the whole UX and UI design process - from user research to final UI design.

        <h1>2. User Research</h1>
        <p>
          In UI for UX designers course, user research result, including one persona, and main features of the application are provided by CareerFoundry beforehand. However, to listen to real users who exercise or use fitness applications, I did extra user research before moving onto user flow creation and wireframing.
          <br>Especially, as a person who has tried to lose weight and be fitted using applications and video tutorials, not going to gym, before, I wanted to make the product as useful as possible - by gathering more opinions and insights. Thus, I interviewed 3 people and conducted user survey which was answered by 23 respondents.

        <p>
          Through the research process, I could gather the following insights:
          <br>Users want to know how long they have worked out.
          <br>Users want to check the how many calories they have eaten and need to consume.
          <br>Users want a description of each exercise by coaching or video tutorials.
          <br>Users want to be provided with exercising plans, routines or daily challenges within the application so that they do not need to make the plans by themselves from scratch.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h1>3. User Personas</h1>
        <p>
          Based on the insights gathered by user research, I created 2 more personas with the one(herein Rebecca) provided by CareerFoundry. I could check and anticipate how the users will think and behave whilst exercising, and what they will want from the application I will make.
